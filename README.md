## Introduction

DietPi is an extremely lightweight Debian-based OS. With images starting at 400MB, that's 3x lighter than "Raspbian Lite". It is highly optimized for minimal CPU and RAM resource usage, ensuring your SBC always runs at its maximum potential. The programs use lightweight Whiptail menus. You'll spend less time staring at the command line, and more time enjoying DietPi.

Use `dietpi-software` to quickly and easily install popular software that's "Ready to run" and optimised for your system. Only the software you need is installed. Use `dietpi-process_tool` to control which installed software has higher or lower priority levels (nice, affinity, policy scheduler).

`dietpi-update` automatically checks for updates and informs you when they are available. Update instantly, without having to write a new image. `dietpi-automation` Allows you to completely automate a DietPi installation with no user input, simply by configuring "dietpi.txt" before powering on.
